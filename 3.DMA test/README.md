- 1 If the test speed, like in the picture, it means that the DMA installation is successful



- 2 if it is a laptop, the speed may be a little lower (laptop performance has been neutered, and may not be a USB3.2 interface) 
- 3 If your Desktop speed is very slow, please check whether the USB Port is 3.2, when you replace the 3.2 ports, and then test again!
